# ABI must be changed:
# - when upstream nginx version is changed
# - when module signature is changed (e.g. time_t change from 32bit integer to 64bit integer https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069997)
# - when symbols/structures/... (exported from header files) are changed
#
# ABI format: nginx-abi-{UPSTREAM_VERSION}-{SUFFIX}
# the {SUFFIX} provides a mechanism on rare cases when there have to be ABI
# changes without upgrading the upstream nginx version, e.g. security updates
# in oldstable

nginx:abi=nginx-abi-1.26.0-1
